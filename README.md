# Pokemon Teambuilder 


This app was created as a solo project while attending Prime Digital Academy to create a full stack app. The requirements were to have the HTTP methods CRUD or Create (Post), Read (Get), Update (Put), and Delete (Delete). 

# Purpose 

Create a full stack app that allows users to create a pokemon team and see their strengths and weaknesses when adding members to the team. 

### Installation Process


Required installation 
Node.js [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)


Create a database named `team_builder`.
Copy and paste code found in `database.sql` into postgres/postico the tables, and dummy data if you'd like.
 
Run `npm run server` in your terminal


Run `npm run client` in your terminal


The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!


### Login 

You will need to regesister with a username and password, this will keep it so you can keep your team just for you. 


# Usage 

The best way to use the Pokemon Teambuilder app is to use it on a standard 16:9 ratio screen. It was optomized for google chrome but will work on modern broswers. The user will create an account, and then be directed to the search page. On the search page type in to the bar a pokemons name (currently does not support capitalization or error if the name is mispelled). You can then see the pokemon you have searched for and then by pressing on the pokeball on the right side they will be added to the team. On the team page you can see what pokemon are currently on the team, from the clicking the details button will take you to a page that displays the stats of the pokemon in a familiar format, some fun details about the pokemon.
